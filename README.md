#Reason for this Project:
I am currently exploring different Javascript frameworks and after evaluating different reviews, I found out that Angular is a powerful, flexible Javascript framework tied directly to HTML and which it has the tools I need to build browser-based applications quickly, specially because of my HTML5 and CSS3 background.  

#About this project
Through this project I am exploring different techniques (editing data in real time using models, using filters to change output at display time, routing requests to separate views, and communciating iwht server side resources).
